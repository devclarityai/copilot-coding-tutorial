## Walkthrough

1. Instructions
2. Mode Explanation - Planning vs. Implementing 
3. Understanding - Codebase
4. Understanding - Tagging
5. Writing - Inline Code (using Copilot)
6. Writing - Simple Ask
  a. The "Learn More About Our Features" button on the index.html page doesn't animate in with the rest of the features section, so it looks weird.
7. Writing - Workflow
  a. We need to create a contact page and then also update the links on the index.html and features.html pages to point to this. For now, we can use the same styling we have on other pages and we can build a basic contact form that you would usually see on a website. Create the tasks for this, don't implement it yet. @task-creator.mdc
  b. markdown-file.md Great, now @implement-it.mdc
