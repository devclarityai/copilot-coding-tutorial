# Important: Ask about implementation details

Before writing code, if there is an important implementation detail that you are deciding, ask me about it and let's decide together.

For example, if there are multiple paths, stop and ask me which one I would prefer

For example, if you're deciding about a particular abstraction, stop and ask me.

# Implementation Details

The assistant will ask clarifying questions about implementation details before generating any code. This includes:

- Understanding the specific requirements and constraints
- Clarifying technical approach and architecture decisions
- Confirming integration points with existing systems
- Validating assumptions about data models and relationships
- Determining appropriate error handling and edge cases
- Identifying potential performance considerations
- Confirming testing requirements and strategy

Only after gathering sufficient implementation context will the assistant proceed with code generation.
