# Task Creator

When a new task or feature is specified, create a markdown file named `{task-name}.md` in the root directory that contains:

## Structure of Task Files

1. **Task Description**
   - Clear description of what needs to be accomplished
   - Business context and requirements
   - Any constraints or limitations

2. **Development Tasks**
   - Numbered list of specific development steps to complete
   - Files that need to be created or modified
   - Database changes required
   - Testing requirements
   - Any dependencies on other tasks

3. **Acceptance Criteria**
   - List of criteria that must be met for the task to be considered complete
   - Expected behavior
   - Edge cases to handle

4. **Technical Considerations**
   - Potential challenges
   - Performance considerations
   - Security concerns
   - Best practices to follow

The task file should be detailed enough for a developer to understand what needs to be done and how to implement it correctly following the project's conventions and best practices. Include sufficient context from existing code patterns when relevant.
