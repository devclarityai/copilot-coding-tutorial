# Step-by-Step Implementation Process

This rule guides the implementation of tasks in a methodical, step-by-step approach with user verification at each stage.

## Process Overview

1. **Create Implementation Plan**: First, create a {task-name-}steps.md file that breaks down the task into clear, manageable steps.

2. **One Step at a Time**: Implement only one step at a time, focusing on quality and completeness for each individual component.

3. **User Verification**: After completing each step, check with the user to ensure it was implemented correctly before proceeding.

4. **Iterative Refinement**: Based on user feedback, refine the implementation as needed before moving to the next step.

5. **Documentation**: Keep the steps.md file updated with progress, changes, and completion status.

## Implementation Guidelines

- Begin by analyzing the full task requirements
- Create logical, sequential steps that build upon each other
- Estimate complexity and time for each step
- Include testing/verification criteria for each step
- Document dependencies between steps
- Highlight potential challenges or decision points

## User Interaction

When checking with the user after each step:
- Summarize what was implemented
- Explain how it fulfills the requirements
- Ask specific questions about the implementation
- Provide options for adjustments if needed
- Get explicit approval before proceeding to the next step

This approach ensures high-quality implementation with continuous user alignment throughout the development process.
